# Contributing to Rise of Machine

### Getting Started

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for development and dependency management.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NewDesignFile/template-directory.git
cd template-directory

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the development server
bun run dev

# Create a new branch for your AI tool
git checkout -b add/your-ai-tool
```

### Adding a Tool

The primary source of truth for all tools is `src/data/tools.json`. This file contains all AI tools organized by category.

> [!NOTE]
> Do NOT edit files in `src/data/tools/*.json` (e.g., `art.json`, `design.json`). These are split automatically from the main `tools.json` during the build process to optimize page loads.

Add your tool entry to the appropriate category in `src/data/tools.json`. Entries should be in alphabetical order within their category.

**Tool Format:**
```json
{
  "title": "Your AI Tool Name",
  "body": "A brief description.",
  "tag": "Free | Freemium | From $X/mo | $X One-time | Not available",
  "url": "https://your-ai-tool.com?ref=riseofmachine.com",
  "date-added": "YYYY-MM-DD"
}
```

*Note: Slugs (e.g., `your-ai-tool`) are automatically generated by the build script. You do not need to provide one unless you want to override the default.*

### Verification & Data Health

Before submitting a Pull Request, you should run the validation script to ensure data integrity and proper formatting.

```bash
bun run check-data
```

This script checks for:
- Missing or malformed URLs
- Missing `http://` or `https://` protocols
- Missing `?ref=riseofmachine.com` parameter
- Duplicate URLs or slugs
- Invalid JSON structure

### Creating a Pull Request

```bash
# Add and commit your changes
git add src/data/tools.json
git commit -m "Add [Tool Name] to [Category]"

# Push to your branch
git push -u origin add/your-ai-tool
```

### Guidelines
- **Alphabetical Order**: Always maintain alphabetical order within categories.
- **Categorization**: Use existing categories. If unsure, use "Xtras" and suggest a new category in your PR description.
- **Conciseness**: Keep the description concise and informative.
- **Protocol**: All URLs should include a valid protocol `https://…` and remain accessible.
- **Ref Parameter**: Make sure the URL includes the reference parameter: `?ref=riseofmachine.com`
- **Validation**: Verify your JSON syntax and data validitiy by running `bun run check-data`.
